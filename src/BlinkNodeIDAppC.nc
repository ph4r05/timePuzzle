 * App for visual verification of the programmed node ID.
 * 
 * After boot "delimitier" is signalled by LEDS:
 * Numbers 1,2,4 are signalled consequently, separated by 250 ms time slot.
 * This is information for user that node has booted and 
 * how LEDS are numbered (bits -> LEDS correspondence).
 * 
 * After this delimitier, the following process takes place:
 * 1. 3 least significant bits of the node id are signalled,
 * 2. 2000 ms sleep,
 * 3. next 3 bits (mask 0b111000) are signalled,
 * 4. 2000 ms sleep,
 * 5. goto: begin (delimitier)
